title: Anchor CMS - What is it?
category: tools
colour: "#FFA64D"
link: http://everydaydesigner.net/development/anchor-cms
excerpt: "Anchor is a lightweight CMS designed to be simple but effective. It was originally created by the mysterious web designer & developer Visual Idiot. It was born out of his frustration with current CMS platforms. They either had a complicated admin interface, a bloated codebase, or in some cases both. Anchor is now mainly developed by Kieron Wilson, with Idiot covering the front-end design and development."
