[Recently I wrote an article](http://david.darn.es/methods/not-enough-in-the-day/ "Not Enough In The Day") about what my daily routine is and asked others to let me know what they do and what their thoughts were. Firstly I'd like to thank everyone who replied. I received a few [tweets](http://twitter.com/daviddarnes "David Darnes on Twitter"), couple of [Google+](https://plus.google.com/100895260126547897177/posts "David Darnes on Google+") messages and even an email. All of them were a nice combination of casual, informative and comical in nature.

I'd like to kick off with an email from college friend and web developer [Benjamin Reid][4], who emailed me with a very detailed schedule of his average weekday:

*[Benjamin Reid][4]: Here's my day, bog standard with nothing planned after work.*

  * *7:30 to - New alarm time, I've been trying to wake up to grab some breakfast and catch up on [Instapaper][5]*
  * *8:30 to - Usual wake up time. Showered and head to work around 9:00 by bike or car*
  * *9:30 to 6:00 - Proper set in stone working hours, rarely work much past 6:00. Lucky in that respect*
  * *6:30 - Back home, cook some food and [play guitar][6] for some time away from the screen*
  * *7:30 to 11:30 - Work on any personal or freelance stuff*
  * *11:30 to 12:30 - Watch an episode of [Lost][7], currently going through it all again. Ha*
  * *1am - Bed*

*Interesting..? Ha. Possibly not. But in [Offscreen mag][8] (which if you haven't read, do get yourself a copy, they're brilliant) they have a whole section dedicated to this topic!*

Now there are a lot of difference between my day and Ben's, but on the face of it he's toiling away as much as I am. Maybe more so, as I think he gets more freelance in than I do at the minute. What I think he does well though is manage to fit in little things to break up the 'work stuff' he has each day. Such as reading on [Instapaper][5], [playing guitar][6] and watching [Lost][7].

My excuse for not doing something similar? I would say that I have to travel further to get into work. However that isn't a very good excuse, travelling to work is part of my job and I should think of it that way. I also have the benefit of still living at home, whereas Ben is having to rustle grub for himself, ergo I should be able to make time to do other things like he does.

This leads me onto a few tweets between myself and another web developer, [Dan Smith][9]. Dan simply said "you work too much", which I took partly as a compliment but mostly as a relief. He also went onto say:

> [Dan Smith][9] – <cite><a title="Dan Smith on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/blistereduk">@blistereduk</a></cite>
>
> Its a whole different ballgame. Again when you get a house and stuff. Enjoy your time away from work. Lifes too short.

Dan is either saying to appreciate I don't have a house to look after, or that when I do get one I should enjoy the time away from work when I'm there. I prefer the later as I do want to find a place of my own, and I'd like to think it would be a 'no work' space… most of the time.

I also had a short conversation with [James Young][10], creative director at [Offroadcode][11]. He made a couple of great points that speak for themselves:

> [James Young][10] – <cite><a title="James Young on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/welcomebrand" data-user-id="40017708">@welcomebrand</a></cite>  
> Don't let the fact you enjoy your job mean you're doing it 16 hours a day. You WILL burn out!

> [James Young][10] – <cite><a title="James Young on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/welcomebrand" data-user-id="40017708">@welcomebrand</a></cite>  
> I make a point of getting out on time and having family time as much as possible

We both agreed that working for a long period on the same thing each day will simply tire you out. There is also a risk that you tire of doing your job in general. For example you might have been really excited to work on a project at the start, but 3 months later you're sick of it no matter how good the design was at the start. I'd hate to think like that towards design in general.

So in review I need to 1. work less and 2. if I am working more than usual make sure to have regular breaks where I can do something more fun. I hope you found this helpful and that it can contribute in someway to making your daily work life a little easier.

Cheers, Dave
