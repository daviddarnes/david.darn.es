Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with [your parents' first meeting][1]{: style="color: #E49800; border-color: #E49800"}. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and [unless you repair the damage][2]{: style="color: #FF6F2A; border-color: #FF6F2A"}, you'll be next.
