Finally upgraded the rest of my site and blog to Jekyll & GitHub Pages. There's still some bugs here and there, but at least it's out there! If you see anything out of place [just let me know](http://twitter.com/daviddarnes). 

So after converting [my main site](https://darn.es/) to Jekyll, I have now switched my blog over to it. Along with my [new open source site](http://daviddarnes.github.io/), which lists everything from my GitHub account.
<!-- more -->

Hoping to write up some of the things I learnt while making these and their inner workings.

Cheers, Dave
