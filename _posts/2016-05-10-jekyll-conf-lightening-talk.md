## Talk Notes

Hi I'm David Darnes, and I'm gonna be talking about doing a lot with a little. So I'm web designer and front-end developer and work at BaseKit, where we build an online website editor. That is when we're not mummifying each other. Overall, I just like building websites, and using the tools online to help me build them. But it got me thinking, how much can we achieve with was essentially not very much? No, this isn't gonna be a talk on how to be lazy or how to cut corners. This is about utilizing the tools that we have online to really build a quite rich website.

So let's begin, and since this is Jekyll Conference we might as well use Jekyll. And of course using GitHub Pages means that we can host the site and manage it with versioning. But what about an SSL certificate? By using GitHub Pages we do get an SSL, but I want to use a custom domain. So that's why I use CloudFlare, and CloudFlare gives me an SSL certificate and user interface to control my URLs.

Let's talk about content. Jekyll provides us with pages, posts, but what about products? Can we add an ecommerce system to our site? Well we can with Gumroad. Gumroad will allow us to add a product directly into our site. All we need to do is add a bit of JavaScript and a link, and that's it. It'll work pretty much like a normal ecommerce site.

Now we have all this content going on, we need a searching method to help our users find stuff they want. There are several tools out there that can add a search to your site. However for me I would use Simple Jekyll Search. If you search for it on GitHub you'll find the repo. What this does is give you a live search tool for your site, allowing users to find anything they want.

What about contacting your users?

and what it does is it gives a live search tool to your website that users 2:02 can find anything they want with 2:05 so what about contacting your users or contacting people that have bought 2:09 products from your site 2:11 yeah we could use discuss but what about a one-to-one contact form 2:16 we can achieve that with phone spree 2:19 spring is it really easy way to add contact form so pretty much any site 2:23 which includes tank websites 2:25 I've even created story online which you can use the links are in the slides 2:30 which are provided in a tweet 2:34 so let's round things up we've got templating and pay generation hosting an 2:40 SSL Certificates ecommerce site search and contact forms 2:47 but some of you might be thinking so what they've you know I know all these 2:52 tools already 2:53 you're not really telling me anything new 2:57 will think 2:57 all these tools allow you to build a lot of things you can do so much with what 3:04 we have online that you know the world is our oyster we can kind of build 3:08 anything we like with no very much work 3:12 but also I'm pretty grateful that these tools even exists 3:16 so thank you to those people who have made all these sorts of tools and helped 3:21 me to build things every day 3:26 I'd like to thank you for watching and I'd like to thank loud cannon for 3:30 allowing me to talk at this conference as I said the links are in the slides 3:35 I'll be tweeting out this slide on the day and you can find me on the links 3:41 below 3:42 thank you again
