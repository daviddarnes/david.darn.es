excerpt: "T’is the season, by which I mean the season where some of us have down-time to do a little practical learning with code. And what better way to learn this time of year than by making a toy you can actually play with. A couple of days ago I set myself the task of creating a sliding puzzle game, that you can actually play, using modern front-end development techniques. In this article I’m going to run through the techniques I used and explain how I put them all together to create the final product which you can see on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/daviddarnes/full/EOqZdw)."
